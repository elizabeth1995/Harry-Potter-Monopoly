These are the files for a monopoly board game that my friend and I designed and made.
Obviously we don't hold the rights to Monopoly or anything from the Harry Potter Universe,
but we believe our creation is fair use.

The images used on the board and cards are mostly chapter illustrations from the books that we found online.
The deeds and cfc/op cards were made using a template found online.
The board we made ourselves.
The tokens came from Harry Potter Scene It.
The money/houses/hotels came from a copy of Monopoly.

You can see photos of the final project here:
